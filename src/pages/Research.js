                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
                  We know very less or none about Death, this is one of the
                  biggest reason not to understand Life. You can not understand
                  right without outlining wrong, true without false and good
                  without bad. Mysteries of death sparks piculier curiosity and
                  fascination in me.
                </p>

                <h3>Why</h3>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
                  It is with profound sadness that I myself taking pleasure to
                  announce the Death of my beloved Me, Gaurav Gautam Shakya,
                  World renowned Billionaire Businessman, Technologist who left
                  the profound immutable legacy behind in the history of
                  Technology and Business innovation. His Contribution to
                  Technology and Engineering is unforgettable specific to
                  Technology and innovation in Healthcare system of India.
                  Lastly, I want to prostrate to my parents for making me
                  existing. I wanna say Goodbye to everyone with whom I shared
                  love of life.
