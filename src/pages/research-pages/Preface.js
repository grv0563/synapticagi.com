          <p>Greetings!</p>
          <p>Thank you for Coming!</p>
          <h4>Who am I? </h4>
          <p>
            Hey, Reader. My name is Gaurav Gautam Shakya. I am an Engineer
            otherwise Electrical engineer by academics for my family and society
            because I pursued electrical engineering discipline at College. I
            found that engineering( not restricted to electricity but the true
            meaning of engineering) is the most fascinating career for me to
            explore the possibilities of life beyond the social norms and
            restrictions. Power of creation is the most powerful mechanism for
            the realisation of the purpose of life and engineering unravels that
            power to any Individual who devotes himself to the true meaning of
            the word "the Engineering" beyond societal norms and standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engineering is not meant to be piece of cake because creation is the
            divine gift so very few people managed to make themselves eligible
            for this gift across the world.
          </p>
          <h4>What is this book about and is it worth reading?</h4>
          <p>
            Humans are the only species on the earth so dominated that they do
            not have any competition. Why is that so? How come humans became so
            dominated and evolved in the Animal kingdom without competition?
            There are many answers to this like humans are the only intelligent
            species on the earth, only got reasoning capabilities, humans are
            emotional beings, reason for domination is evolution and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Many people on the earth can not comprehend the complexity of social
            enterprises such as family, marriage, intelligence and Emotional
            intelligence, Government, Legal Framework, capital punishment,
            system of exchange, healthcare system, learning and education,
            ethics and morality, human rights, and many cosmological and
            environmental wonders, disasters and calamities.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Of Course these are specialised domains of knowledge. one can only
            get specialisation in one or two domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            so, In this book, I tried to comprehend origins and reasons for
            founding these complex domains of knowledge separate from others.
            Based on these existential reasons, I tried to comprehend the
            objectives and goals of these disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The scope of incomprehensibly wide. So these are just my
            understanding. Don't take me too seriously, have fun, and be curious
            about the possibilities around you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for having such scope is that the problem I Interested in
            has the same kind of scope. Content, Ideas and reasoning in this
            book augmented the solution of the problem of my interest. The
            problems is engineering super intelligence. Why super intelligence
            and what value does it add to our life or is it for the BuzzFeed of
            AI, general and Super Intelligence? That's great and profound
            question. Let me cover some basics for you to understand my point of
            view towards super intelligence. Before that I must confront that it
            is not completely because of BuzzFeed. I choose to pursue this
            career to engineer super intelligence because in technology,
            especially computer engineering and Information Technology, every
            subfield is overwhelmingly crowded and very narrow in scope. I was
            looking for a new emerging and challenging field for myself.
            Initially I hesitated because of buzzwords and sci-fi expectations
            of people which did not attract me as an engineering discipline.
            Accidentally, I started learning fuzzy logic and neural network as
            my elective subject in my final year in college.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually I fell in love with the scope and emerging, complex
            nature. One advantage everyone gets in pioneering is that no-one
            knows what works and what doesn't. This is the biggest advantage for
            creating something very useful and revolutionary. With this thinking
            I immersed myself in the study to find the solution for super
            intelligence
          </p>
          <p>
            I assume that you got the answer for the last question? Next comes,
            why and How would I accomplish this grand Vision of solving
            intelligence?
          </p>
          <p>Answer for why is</p>
          <p>
            Humans are very good at cognitive skills such as thinking,
            imagination, reasoning and finding solutions to complex problems or
            producing scientific explanations. There is a disparity between the
            mental world and physical world. Mental world is agile, dynamic,
            easily adaptable in any complex situation. On the other hand, the
            physical world is full of frictions. It is very complex, hard
            bounded with physical constraints and restrictions, Prolonged,
            difficult to recover and reverse engineer, less likely to adapt in
            most situations. These two worlds are very critical for our life to
            accomplish balance between both. To survive and evolve further, it
            is necessary to make balance both in terms of agility, adaptability
            and consensus among natural constraints
          </p>
          <p>
            My mental schematic for the Super Intelligence is to make sure the
            mental world keeps evolving and becoming more and more advanced in
            cognitive abilities and simultaneously the physical world must
            eliminate the physical constraint and become more agile and
            adaptable like the mental world. If that is possible with technology
            and engineering that means that is the way to engineer super
            Intelligence.
          </p>
          <h4>Why did I write this book? </h4>
          <p>
            I did not plan to write this book in the first place. I was
            wondering around for the long time trying to understand the
            environment around me, people and social enterprise which evolved as
            pretty complex social organisation filled with social norms,
            cultural diversity and disparity, stereotypes, vulnerabilities,
            love, compassion, brutality, Learning, confusion, distraction,
            Adolescence, self-loathing, hate, regret, trauma and depression and
            so on and on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definition of these concepts and disciplines is not very much clear
            and understood. The responsibility is given to a specialised system
            of Education for defining these concepts and disciplines and
            teaching others so that they can make good decisions, understand
            people and cloud make harmony with existing society of systems and
            can distinguish between good life and bad life. But unfortunately,
            over the centuries and decades this responsibility got distracted
            from the founding vision for having standalone systems for training
            and education. Actors in the education system limit themselves to
            just teaching generations for their professional competencies,
            efficiency and effectiveness only in the legal enterprises such
            government, corporations and industrial workplace. Very less focus
            on the personal efficiency and effectiveness in social enterprises
            such as family, marriage, personal relationship, self development,
            social norms, diversity and disparity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning styles, techniques and practices in the educational
            settings does not have correlation with the natural learning
            principles which promotes curiosity and constant persuasion of
            learning, useful creations and improvement beyond scope knowledge.
            There is reason to say that current educational settings do not
            follow the principles of natural curiosity and internal drive and
            hunger. If you visualise your life experience, you can easily point
            out that the most important and profound learning you get always
            comes through pain, uncertainty and discomfort. Barely you got any
            useful learning without pain, discomfort and uncertainty. But
            current institutions are trying hard to make education simple, easy
            and fun. These efforts might be sincere and for Goodwill but they're
            on the wrong track to make the education accessible to everyone but
            not necessarily the education and learning needed by the students.
          </p>
          <p>These institutions are trying to do things.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Education should be fun, fast and time constrained.</li>
            <li>
              2. Removing uncertainty by inserting hard bounded syllabus which
              leaves no room for uncertainty and curiosity
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both things are against natural learning. </p>
          <p>
            When I spent an unjustified amount of time trying to learn something
            useful by offshoring learning and development discretion to these
            distracted institutions. Eventually I realised the kind of life I
            want can not be achieved by offshoring the most precious discretion
            for taking care of my learning and development. So I gathered some
            courage and started my journey for self learning and training.
            Responsibility of taking care of your own learning and development
            is huge. Requires a lot of time, patience and determination.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started it was nightmare for me and very hard to get single
            ray of sunshine what to do and where to begin. I wondered for 3 to 4
            year before realising the reality and how big the the responsibility
            I took for myself and why people usually look for teachers and
            institutions. This experience is ineffable for me. That 4 years of
            patience made me too curious about the World around me.
            Consequently, I assigned myself the most difficult task, which is to
            organise world knowledge with logic and reasoning.
          </p>
          <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>
            I tried to be rational and not to be biassed with my own beliefs and
            stereotypes. But You are free to challenge these ideas. Even my
            advice to you is that you must challenge these ideas and try to
            improve your understanding. Do not take me too seriously. These are
            logical prototype models for the human history of problem solving. I
            simplified it to digest in one or two sittings and quickly reason
            over the current major problems such as clean water, climate change,
            incurable disease and their roots and importance in human history.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are an expert in any capacity and think my facts are not
            scientifically and historically right and my way of consolidation of
            humongous history and rationale of these ideas is not right in any
            capacity. Yes, you can be right but I am just Engineer, that is why
            I am biassed or trained myself to be biassed to abstractions,
            reducing complexity and time, approximating problems to make useful
            trade-offs
          </p>
          <h4>Why this book? </h4>
          <p>
            I am writing this book to understand the bigger circle of problems
            and their importance in short as well as long term. We can also have
            the understanding of human problems with their historical roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many times I found myself hanging around the problem and facing
            difficulty to understand the impact and importance of solution’s of
            that problem which lead me to give up and move to look for new
            problems because previous one look less important and less
            impactful. But later I realised I have not developed any metal
            framework through which I can scrutinise the problem and their
            impact in the most effective and biggest context. Almost Every
            problem on earth has its roots in history. If we have some framework
            or body of Knowledge(not as exhaustive as Human History or
            Evolutionary sciences or social science) which can give you the
            bigger complete picture of Human problems and how they solve them.
            What kind of problems are still around us invisible or
            incomprehensible with today’s language, technology and our complex
            social organisational understanding of humans. I am writing this
            book to myself so that I can understand the bigger picture of
            problems and be able to pick one or more urgent and impactful
            problems to dedicate myself to solve
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is not meant to be well scrutinised and correct facts
            about the history of human evolution.
          </p>
          <h4>Use of this book, Value extraction from this book? </h4>
          <p>
            One possible use case could be that this book can be used to build a
            logical picture of problems which have gone through in the past, are
            facing in the present and will continue to face or will face
            completely new, different problems in the future. For Building this
            logical picture, you can use discretion to avoid going through all
            human evolution.
          </p>
          <h4>Methodology used in this book</h4>
          <p>
            Methodology for this research is casual in nature. I will be
            traversing the whole human evolution( only event of monumental
            significance for humanity) by asking questions and answering the
            causal relationship between the events that have happened in history
            and their implications in the present.
