Why super intelligence\n            and what value does it add to our life or is it for the BuzzFeed of\n            AI, general and Super Intelligence? That's great and profound\n            question. Let me cover some basics for you to understand my point of\n            view towards super intelligence. Before that I must confront that it\n            is not completely because of BuzzFeed. I choose to pursue this\n            career to engineer super intelligence because in technology,\n            especially computer engineering and Information Technology, every\n            subfield is overwhelmingly crowded and very narrow in scope. I was\n            looking for a new emerging and challenging field for myself.\n            Initially I hesitated because of buzzwords and sci-fi expectations\n            of people which did not attract me as an engineering discipline.\n            Accidentally, I started learning fuzzy logic and neural network as\n            my elective subject in my final year in college.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Eventually I fell in love with the scope and emerging, complex\n            nature. One advantage everyone gets in pioneering is that no-one\n            knows what works and what doesn't. This is the biggest advantage for\n            creating something very useful and revolutionary. With this thinking\n            I immersed myself in the study to find the solution for super\n            intelligence\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I assume that you got the answer for the last question? Next comes,\n            why and How would I accomplish this grand Vision of solving\n            intelligence?\n          </p>\n          <p>Answer for why is</p>\n          <p>\n            Humans are very good at cognitive skills such as thinking,\n            imagination, reasoning and finding solutions to complex problems or\n            producing scientific explanations. There is a disparity between the\n            mental world and physical world. Mental world is agile, dynamic,\n            easily adaptable in any complex situation. On the other hand, the\n            physical world is full of frictions. It is very complex, hard\n            bounded with physical constraints and restrictions, Prolonged,\n            difficult to recover and reverse engineer, less likely to adapt in\n            most situations. These two worlds are very critical for our life to\n            accomplish balance between both. To survive and evolve further, it\n            is necessary to make balance both in terms of agility, adaptability\n            and consensus among natural constraints\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            My mental schematic for the Super Intelligence is to make sure the\n            mental world keeps evolving and becoming more and more advanced in\n            cognitive abilities and simultaneously the physical world must\n            eliminate the physical constraint and become more agile and\n            adaptable like the mental world. If that is possible with technology\n            and engineering that means that is the way to engineer super\n            Intelligence.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Why did I write this book? </h4>\n          <p>\n            I did not plan to write this book in the first place. I was\n            wondering around for the long time trying to understand the\n            environment around me, people and social enterprise which evolved as\n            pretty complex social organisation filled with social norms,\n            cultural diversity and disparity, stereotypes, vulnerabilities,\n            love, compassion, brutality, Learning, confusion, distraction,\n            Adolescence, self-loathing, hate, regret, trauma and depression and\n            so on and on.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Definition of these concepts and disciplines is not very much clear\n            and understood. The responsibility is given to a specialised system\n            of Education for defining these concepts and disciplines and\n            teaching others so that they can make good decisions, understand\n            people and cloud make harmony with existing society of systems and\n            can distinguish between good life and bad life. But unfortunately,\n            over the centuries and decades this responsibility got distracted\n            from the founding vision for having standalone systems for training\n            and education. Actors in the education system limit themselves to\n            just teaching generations for their professional competencies,\n            efficiency and effectiveness only in the legal enterprises such\n            government, corporations and industrial workplace. Very less focus\n            on the personal efficiency and effectiveness in social enterprises\n            such as family, marriage, personal relationship, self development,\n            social norms, diversity and disparity.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Learning styles, techniques and practices in the educational\n            settings does not have correlation with the natural learning\n            principles which promotes curiosity and constant persuasion of\n            learning, useful creations and improvement beyond scope knowledge.\n            There is reason to say that current educational settings do not\n            follow the principles of natural curiosity and internal drive and\n            hunger. If you visualise your life experience, you can easily point\n            out that the most important and profound learning you get always\n            comes through pain, uncertainty and discomfort. Barely you got any\n            useful learning without pain, discomfort and uncertainty. But\n            current institutions are trying hard to make education simple, easy\n            and fun. These efforts might be sincere and for Goodwill but they're\n            on the wrong track to make the education accessible to everyone but\n            not necessarily the education and learning needed by the students.\n          </p>\n          <p>These institutions are trying to do things.</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>1. Education should be fun, fast and time constrained.</li>\n            <li>\n              2. Removing uncertainty by inserting hard bounded syllabus which\n              leaves no room for uncertainty and curiosity\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Both things are against natural learning. </p>\n          <p>\n            When I spent an unjustified amount of time trying to learn something\n            useful by offshoring learning and development discretion to these\n            distracted institutions. Eventually I realised the kind of life I\n            want can not be achieved by offshoring the most precious discretion\n            for taking care of my learning and development. So I gathered some\n            courage and started my journey for self learning and training.\n            Responsibility of taking care of your own learning and development\n            is huge. Requires a lot of time, patience and determination.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When I started it was nightmare for me and very hard to get single\n            ray of sunshine what to do and where to begin. I wondered for 3 to 4\n            year before realising the reality and how big the the responsibility\n            I took for myself and why people usually look for teachers and\n            institutions. This experience is ineffable for me. That 4 years of\n            patience made me too curious about the World around me.\n            Consequently, I assigned myself the most difficult task, which is to\n            organise world knowledge with logic and reasoning.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Disclaimer</h4>\n          <p>\n            I tried to be rational and not to be biassed with my own beliefs and\n            stereotypes. But You are free to challenge these ideas. Even my\n            advice to you is that you must challenge these ideas and try to\n            improve your understanding. Do not take me too seriously. These are\n            logical prototype models for the human history of problem solving. I\n            simplified it to digest in one or two sittings and quickly reason\n            over the current major problems such as clean water, climate change,\n            incurable disease and their roots and importance in human history.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If you are an expert in any capacity and think my facts are not\n            scientifically and historically right and my way of consolidation of\n            humongous history and rationale of these ideas is not right in any\n            capacity. Yes, you can be right but I am just Engineer, that is why\n            I am biassed or trained myself to be biassed to abstractions,\n            reducing complexity and time, approximating problems to make useful\n            trade-offs\n          </p>\n          <h4>Why this book? </h4>\n          <p>\n            I am writing this book to understand the bigger circle of problems\n            and their importance in short as well as long term. We can also have\n            the understanding of human problems with their historical roots.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Many times I found myself hanging around the problem and facing\n            difficulty to understand the impact and importance of solution’s of\n            that problem which lead me to give up and move to look for new\n            problems because previous one look less important and less\n            impactful. But later I realised I have not developed any metal\n            framework through which I can scrutinise the problem and their\n            impact in the most effective and biggest context. Almost Every\n            problem on earth has its roots in history. If we have some framework\n            or body of Knowledge(not as exhaustive as Human History or\n            Evolutionary sciences or social science) which can give you the\n            bigger complete picture of Human problems and how they solve them.\n            What kind of problems are still around us invisible or\n            incomprehensible with today’s language, technology and our complex\n            social organisational understanding of humans. I am writing this\n            book to myself so that I can understand the bigger picture of\n            problems and be able to pick one or more urgent and impactful\n            problems to dedicate myself to solve\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This book is not meant to be well scrutinised and correct facts\n            about the history of human evolution.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Use of this book, Value extraction from this book? </h4>\n          <p>\n            One possible use case could be that this book can be used to build a\n            logical picture of problems which have gone through in the past, are\n            facing in the present and will continue to face or will face\n            completely new, different problems in the future. For Building this\n            logical picture, you can use discretion to avoid going through all\n            human evolution.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Methodology used in this book</h4>\n          <p>\n            Methodology for this research is casual in nature. I will be\n            traversing the whole human evolution( only event of monumental\n            significance for humanity) by asking questions and answering the\n            causal relationship between the events that have happened in history\n            and their implications in the present.\n          </p>\n          <a href=\"/intro\">Next Chapter</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Preface;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,cAAc;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA,EAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AACtB,SAASC,OAAOA,CAAA,EAAG;EACjB,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAD,QAAA,eAC7BJ,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAO;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAU;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAqB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC5BT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAU;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACnBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAWH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAgD;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzDT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAOH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GACG,GAAG,EAAC,mXAM2C,EAAC,GAAG;QAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACnD,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAGH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GACG,GAAG,EAAC,mKAIP;QAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAkBH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAOH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAiB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAaH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAA2B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpCT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QASH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAgBH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAeH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA2C;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAClDT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,gBACEJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAsD;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/DT,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAGJ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA0C;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjDT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QASH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QASH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAU;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACnBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QASH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAe;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAkBH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAGH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAmD;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5DT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAOH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAA6B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;UAAGU,IAAI,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAC;QAAY;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC9B;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH;EAAC,gBACN,CAAC;AAEP;AAACE,EAAA,GApQQR,OAAO;AAsQhB,eAAeA,OAAO;AAAC,IAAAQ,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
