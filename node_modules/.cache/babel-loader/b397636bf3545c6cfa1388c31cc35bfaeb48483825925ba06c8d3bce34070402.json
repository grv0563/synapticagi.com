Almost Every\n            problem on earth has its roots in history. If we have some framework\n            or body of Knowledge(not as exhaustive as Human History or\n            Evolutionary sciences or social science) which can give you the\n            bigger complete picture of Human problems and how they solve them.\n            What kind of problems are still around us invisible or\n            incomprehensible with today’s language, technology and our complex\n            social organisational understanding of humans. I am writing this\n            book to myself so that I can understand the bigger picture of\n            problems and be able to pick one or more urgent and impactful\n            problems to dedicate myself to solve\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This book is not meant to be well scrutinised and correct facts\n            about the history of human evolution.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Use of this book, Value extraction from this book? </h4>\n          <p>\n            One possible use case could be that this book can be used to build a\n            logical picture of problems which have gone through in the past, are\n            facing in the present and will continue to face or will face\n            completely new, different problems in the future. For Building this\n            logical picture, you can use discretion to avoid going through all\n            human evolution.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Methodology used in this book</h4>\n          <p>\n            Methodology for this research is casual in nature. I will be\n            traversing the whole human evolution( only event of monumental\n            significance for humanity) by asking questions and answering the\n            causal relationship between the events that have happened in history\n            and their implications in the present.\n          </p>\n          <a href=\"/intro\">Next Chapter</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Preface;\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,MAAO,cAAc,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,CAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA,yBACtB,QAAS,CAAAC,OAAOA,CAAA,CAAG,CACjB,mBACEL,IAAA,CAAAI,SAAA,EAAAE,QAAA,cACEN,IAAA,QAAKO,SAAS,CAAC,gBAAgB,CAAAD,QAAA,cAC7BJ,KAAA,QAAKK,SAAS,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAAAD,QAAA,eAChCN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,SAAO,CAAI,CAAC,cAChBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,YAAU,CAAG,CAAC,cACjBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,uBAAqB,CAAG,CAAC,cAC5BN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,cACnBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,spBAWH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,yKAIH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,kDAAgD,CAAI,CAAC,cACzDN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,+YAOH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,KAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,EACG,GAAG,CAAC,mXAM2C,CAAC,GAAG,EACnD,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,8GAGH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,4OAKH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,KAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,EACG,GAAG,CAAC,mKAIP,EAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,2kCAkBH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,sVAOH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,+IAIH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,mBAAiB,CAAG,CAAC,cACxBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,0vBAaH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,kZAQH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,6BAA2B,CAAI,CAAC,cACpCN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,4cASH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,o8BAgBH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,q5BAeH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,6CAA2C,CAAG,CAAC,cAClDJ,KAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,eACEN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,wDAAsD,CAAI,CAAC,cAC/DN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,+GAGJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,cACLN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,4CAA0C,CAAG,CAAC,cACjDN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,ghBASH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,ggBASH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,cACnBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,yhBASH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,0ZAQH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,iBAAe,CAAI,CAAC,cACxBN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,0MAIH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,qiCAkBH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,uGAGH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,qDAAmD,CAAI,CAAC,cAC5DN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,gWAOH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,OAAAM,QAAA,CAAI,+BAA6B,CAAI,CAAC,cACtCN,IAAA,MAAAM,QAAA,CAAG,0SAMH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJN,IAAA,MAAGQ,IAAI,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAF,QAAA,CAAC,cAAY,CAAG,CAAC,EAC9B,CAAC,CACH,CAAC,CACN,CAAC,CAEP,CAEA,cAAe,CAAAD,OAAO","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
